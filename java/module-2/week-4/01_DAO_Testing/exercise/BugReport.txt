    setting billable in the SQL update statement

Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    getBillableHours_returns_correct_total
Expected output:
    only hours that are billable
Actual output:
    all hours whether or not they are billable

    Add a condition to the where clause so that it only returns results if billable is true

Bug 3

Test that demonstrates problem:
    getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee
Expected output:
    a list of timesheets with a size of 2
Actual output:
    a list of timesheets with a size of 1
How did you fix this bug?
    change the if statement to a while statement because the list would always stop after 1 due to the if statement
